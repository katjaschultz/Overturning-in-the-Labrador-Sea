# Overturning-in-the-Labrador-Sea

In this repository I will (soon) share code, data and some output of my master thesis titled "The impact of Deep convection on overturning in the Labrador Sea".
I utitlized Argo float data to estimate overturning at the AR7W line and created seasonal and decadal composites using optimal interpolation.
